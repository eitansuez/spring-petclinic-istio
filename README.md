# Spring PetClinic on Istio

This repository is derived from [Spring PetClinic Cloud](https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-cloud), which in turn was derived from the [Spring PetClinic Microservices](https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-microservices) version.

For instructions to set up, build, deploy, and configure PetClinic with Istio, along with explorations of the capabilities unlocked by Istio, see https://eitansuez.github.io/spring-petclinic-istio/
