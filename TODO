--todo:

- Replace resilience4j configuration with istio circuit breaker configuration
  - start by configuring the 4s timeout with istio instead of resilience4j.
  - there's also the matter of the fallback and its accompanying test.

- Gain familiarity with skaffold & learn to spin this system up with skaffold

- Leverage workload identity: add an authorization policy that restricts who can talk to each db

- Re-implement backend in Kotlin?  Can then remove use of Lombok and other cruft.

- The codebase appears to be out of sync with the monolith version of petclinic:
    - the less files are now scss files
    - i don't see the wro plugin anymore
    - the java class names are different

--misc:
Keeping a tight loop between dev and deploy with skaffold or similar tool
  - https://skaffold.dev/
  - https://tilt.dev/

Has someone already adapted PetClinic for Istio?

--done:
x review the docs/readme learn the basics of using the repo
x setup a local k3d environment with registry, install istio
x review the code
x understand the app and how it functions
x reconfigure gateway routing of service api endpoints in istio terms using a VirtualService
x add prometheus annotations to app deployment manifests so that sidecar can pick up app container metrics
x eliminate unneeded spring cloud dependencies
x learn to build the code, create the images, and push them to a registry that k8s can fetch images from
x deploy the app to k8s (manifests)
x configure/deploy the mysql databases for each service
x update to latest stable version of jkd/jvm - from 11 to 19
x remove spring cloud kubernetes, can revisit that at a later time
x update version of spring/springboot to latest stable: 2.6.3 -> 2.7.5
x read up on spring cloud kubernetes - https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-kubernetes/docs/current/reference/html/
x is the manifest role.yaml (that configures a role named "namespacereader" with rolebinding) even needed?
  i think so.  it has to do with the ability to read the application.yaml info from the configmap.
  see the spring cloud kubernetes project documentation for more information.
x give each service its own service account
x Deploy the app and see it work
x get routing to function
x Get to the bottom of why services often fail to come up or take an inordinate amount of time.
  need to pay closer attention to service resource requests/limits
x Run prometheus, grafana, jaeger & kiali; send traffic to the app; watch kiali dashboard
x Verify/fix trace headers propagation
  x see https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/observability/distributed-tracing/overview/
  x replace deprecated spring cloud sleuth with new way to propagate distributed traces
x Verify that app metrics are collected in addition to envoy metrics
x accessing http://localhost/#!/owners/details/6 from a browser
   results in being able to see the full distributed trace,
   but when i use siege i cannot see the backend services in kiali
   - that's because you are calling the frontend url which assumes a browser that executes javascript to then call the backend api endpoint
x improve the build files - i see a lot of repetition; perhaps even incorrect parent-child relationship configuration
x Remind yourself how to work with maven multi-module projects.
  I suspect that many of the common dependencies in the child modules can be pulled into the parent.
x Replace build system: mvn -> gradle
  - there may be an issue with the wro plugin for gradle and the converstion of .less files to .css in the build.
    dsyer worked on this, see:
    - https://github.com/wro4j/wro4j-gradle-plugin/issues/2
     - https://github.com/dsyer/spring-petclinic/tree/gradle
  changed my mind.  this is not important.  stick with maven for now.
